# Logical-Vector-clocks-in-Operating-Systems
Logical.cpp - Logical clocks implemented in C++ incorporated with Message Passing interface (MPI) for sending and receivin messages.
My program reads in a set of simulation parameters and then print the logical clocks associated with each event.
Vector.cpp - Vector clocks based on Lamport's algorithm implemented in C++ incorporated with Message Passing interface (MPI) for 
sending and receivin messages.My program reads in a set of simulation 
parameters and then print the vector clocks associated with each event.
